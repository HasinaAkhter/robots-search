## Robots search app

A react app that can search a robots from a display of robots by typing the first one or two alphabets of the specific robot's name.

### What we have learned here

While building the projects we used:

1. React's eco-syestem: create react app coming with development packages
2. Components and how they communicate with each other
3. props and state
4. react form
5. use of API, react's life-cycle hook, use of componentDidMount()
6. Data just flows down one way and any time a child component changes, they just trigger an event on the parent
